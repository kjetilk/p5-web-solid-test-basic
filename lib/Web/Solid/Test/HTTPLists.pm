=head1 NAME

Web::Solid::Test::HTTPLists - Solid Tests using HTTP objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::FITesque::RDF;
  my $suite = Test::FITesque::RDF->new(source => $file, base_uri => $ENV{SOLID_REMOTE_BASE})->suite;
  $suite->run_tests;
  done_testing;

A script C<tests/httplists.t> can be used to launch some of these tests.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Introduction

The basic idea with these tests is to simplify reuse and formulation
of fixture tables using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), in
this case using HTTP vocabularies to formulate lists of requests and
responses. It is in a very early stage, but there are running tests in
this module. See L<Web::Solid::Test::Basic> for more on the
philosophy.

This system is built on L<Test::FITesque::RDF>, which adds RDF fixture
tables to L<Test::FITesque>.

=head1 IMPLEMENTED TESTS

Apart from some author tests in this module, examples of actual tests
can be found in the L<Solid Test Suite|https://github.com/solid/test-suite>.


=head2 Test scripts

In general, tests are formulated in RDF fixture tables, which
parameterizes the test cases. This parameterization is then given to
the test scripts. It is intended therefore that only a small number of
fairly general test scripts will be needed to provide an extensive
test suite.

These are the test scripts implemented in this module:


=head2 C<< http_req_res_list >>

Runs a list of HTTP request response pairs, checking response against the response.

=head3 Parameters

=over

=item * C<test:steps>

A list of request-response pairs, declared using:

=over

=item * C<test:request>

An RDF list of requests that will be executed towards the server in C<SOLID_REMOTE_BASE>.

=item * C<test:response_assertion>

An RDF list of responses that will be used as corresponding expected responses in the tests.

=back

=item * C<http://example.org/httplist/param#bearer>

A bearer token that if present will be used to authenticate the
requests given by the above list. The object of this predicate can
either be a literal bearer token, or a URL, in which case, it will be
dereferenced and the content will be used as the bearer token.

=back

=head3 Environment

None

=head3 Implements

=over

=item 1. That responses are L<HTTP::Response> objects.

=item 2. That the response code matches the expected one if given.

=item 3. That all headers given in the asserted response matches a
header in the actual response.

=back


=head2 C<< http_req_res_list_regex_reuser >>

Runs a list of two HTTP request response pairs, using a regular
expression from the first request to set the request URL of the
second.

=head3 Parameters

Uses C<test:steps> like above.

Additionally, the first request may have a regular expression that can
be used to parse data for the next request. To examine the Link
header, a response message can be formulated like (note, it practice
it would be more complex):

 :check_acl_location_res a http:ResponseMessage ;
    httph:link '<(.*?)>;\\s+rel="acl"'^^dqm:regex ;
    http:status 200 .

The resulting match is placed in an array that will be used to set the
Request URI of the next request.


=head3 Environment

None

=head3 Implements

=over

=item 1. That the regular expression in the first request matches.

=item 2. That responses are L<HTTP::Response> objects.

=item 3. That the response code matches the expected one if given.

=item 4. That headers that are not matched as regular expression but
given in the asserted response matches a header in the actual
response.

=back


=head3 Assumptions

See the source for details.




=head1 NOTE

The parameters above are in the RDF formulated as actual full URIs,
but where the local part is used here and resolved by the
L<Test::FITesque::RDF> framework, see its documentation for details.

To run tests against a server that uses HTTPS but uses a self-signed
certificate, the certificate's fingerprint needs to be supplied to the
test script to use in the validation. To set this, use the environment
variable C<SOLID_SSL_FINGERPRINT>. The fingerprint can be obtained for
example by visiting the system under test in a browser and examine the
certificate details from there.




=head1 TODO

The namespaces used in the current fixture tables are examples, and
will be changed before an 1.0 release of the system.
